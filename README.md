# AngularJS Lite
An experiment into exploring the inner workings of AngularJS â€“ by implementing a lightweight version (basically, omitting browser hacks and other such corner cases) from the ground up using test-driven development practices.

The most important things I aim to learn
---
- How to write test-driven JavaScript. By using TDD to build my own implementation of AngularJS, I'll get into the flow of writing JavaScript code in a test-driven fashion.
- How to create and maintain a substantial JavaScript codebase. How to organize code, and how to manage it with a modern toolset built on NPM, Browserify, and Jasmine.
